1.1.3 Section Review  - J. Gavin Ray (5/7/2012)

1.	An assembler is a utility program that converts source code programs
	from assembly language into machine language.  A linker is a utility
	program that combined individual files created by an assembler into 
	a single executable program.
2.	It will broaded a students knowledge of an operating system by showing
	how interrupt handlers, system calls, and common memory areas function
	within the OS.
3.	High level languages such as C and Java have a one-to-many relationship
	with assembly language and machine language.  A single statement of C
	expands into multiple assembly language or machine instructions.
4.	A language whose source programs an be compiled and run on a wide
	variety of computer systems is said to be portable.  A C program for
	example, should compile and run on just about any computer, unless
	it makes specific references to library functions that exist under a
	single operating system.
5.	Assembly language is not portable because it is designed for a specific
	processor family.  There are a number of different assembly languages
	widely used today, each based on a processor family.  Some well-known
	processor families such as the x86, Vax, and Motorola 68x00 therefore
	have their own language.
