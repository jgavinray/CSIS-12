1 & 2.	Bits are numbered sequentially starting at zero on the right
	side and increasing toward the left.  The bit on the left is
	called the most significant bit (MSB), and the bit on the right
	is the least significant bit (LSB).  An example is below

	1011001010011100
	^              ^
	MSB            LSB
