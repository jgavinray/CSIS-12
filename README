This entire Git includes all the coursework from the class.  It is being
placed on Github to afford myself easy access to it at a later date.  This
is also being used to catalog my progress so I can review for errors later
on.  Each chapter directory has within it an Assignment file, which lists
the assignments per that chapter as outlined by Mr. Van Tassel

* Note some of the files contained in this git are direct copys from the
supplimental material that came the book: Assembly Language for x86 
processors by Kip R. Irvine (Sixth Edition)
