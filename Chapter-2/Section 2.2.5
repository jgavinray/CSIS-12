2.2.5 Section Review  - J. Gavin Ray (5/24/2012)


1.	Protected Mode, Virtual-8086 Mode, and Real-Address Mode
2.	
	a.	EAX 
	b.	EBX 
	c.	ECX
	d.	EDX	
	e.	EBP
	f.	ESP
	g.	ESI
	h.	EDI
3.	
	a.	CS
	b.	SS
	c.	DS
	d.	ES
	e.	FS
	f.	GS
4.	The CPU uses ECX as a loop counter
5.	ESP addresses data on the stack (a system memory structure).  It is rarely used for ordinary
	arithmetic or data transfer.  It is often called the extended stack pointer register.

	EBP is used by high-level languages to reference function parameters and local variables on
	the stack.  It should not be used for ordinary arithmetic or data transfer except at an 
	advanced level of programming.  It is often called the extended frame pointer register.
6.	
	a.	Carry flag (CF) is set when the results of an UNSIGNED arithmetic operation is too
		large to fit into the destination.
	b.	Overflow flag (OF) is set when the results of a SIGNED arithmetic operation is too
		large or too small to fit into the destination.
	c.	Sign flag (SF) is set when the result of an arithmetic or logical operation generates
		a negative result.
	d.	Zero flag (ZF) is set when the results of an arithmetic or logical operation generates
		a result of zero.
	e.	Auxiliary carry flag (AC) is set when an arithmetic operation causes a carry from bit 3 to
		bit 4 in an 8-bit operand.
	f.	Parity flag (PF) is set if the least-significant byte in the result contains an even number
		of 1 bits.  Otherwise, PF is clear.  In general, it is used for error checking when there is
		a possibility that data might be altered or corrupted.
7.	Carry Flag (CF)
8.	Overflow flag (OF)
9.	Sign flag (SF)
10.	The floating-point unit (FPU) performs high-speed floating-point arithmetic.  From the Intel486 onward,
	the FPU has been interated into the main processor chip.
