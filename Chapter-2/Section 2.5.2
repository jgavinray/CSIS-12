2.5.2 Section Review  - J. Gavin Ray (5/29/2012)

1. 	Library functions are the most portable as they can be transferred 
	to not only different hardware, but also different operating systems.
	Examples of this are C, Java, etc. libraries.
2.	BIOS is a collection of low-level subroutines that communicate directly
	with hardware devices.
3.	Because BIOS is a collection of low-level subroutines, it allows for the
	functionality of a device, however device drivers permit the operating 
	system to communicate directly with hardware.  This is important due to
	the fact that a piece of hardware may have special requests by an operating
	system to perform a certain task.  The device driver has specific routines
	to allow the device to perform at the operating systems request.
4.	According to figure 2-13 the level between the OS function and the Hardware
	is level 1 - BIOS function.
5.	Assembly language programs have the power and flexibility in the area
	of input/output programming.  Levels to be chosen from according to figure
	2-14 shows Library (Level 3), OS Function (Level 2), BIOS Function (Level 1),
	Hardware (Level 0)
